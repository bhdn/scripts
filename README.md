scripts
=======

Collection of shell scripts I've written to control my computer

chkblayout
----------
Switch keyboardlayout. For use in window managers/desktop environments.

dir.sh
------
Generate a custom directory listing. Most usable for web servers. I've written
it because I needed more features than the default listing of the nginx server
(I didn't wanted to compile-in an extra module). It is based on the dirlisting
module of `lighttpd`.
